                <p>Creativity has always been my greatest asset, guiding me through both problem-solving challenges and artistic
                    endeavors. It was during my Fundamentals of Digital and Online Media course that I first encountered front-end development,
                    igniting my passion for the blend of problem-solving and design. This led me to pursue further education in Texas Stateâ€™s
                    Digital Media Innovations Program, with a dedicated focus on front-end development and design. </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>After completing my first internship with the software team at SXSW as a Designer and Developer, I gained
                    invaluable insights into the potential of working on projects at a larger scale. This experience has made
                    me want to focus on helping other creatives in achieving their goals through my expertise in front-end development and design.</p>
                <br></br>

                <p>In my free time, I enjoy learning more about music production, practicing different musical instruments, going on hikes
                    to reconnect with nature, and spending quality time with family and friends.</p>
